This repo constains my first front end project so it was my first time
experimenting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It is a weather website that collects data from the OpenWeather API.
If for some reasons you want to try it for yourself you only need an OpenWeather
API key. If you don't have one, you can generate one from there website
